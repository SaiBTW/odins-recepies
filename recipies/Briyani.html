    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved for special occasions such
       as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely
       worth it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.

    <p>
        This really isn't the best biryani recipe I've made, but it's fast for biryani so I thought I'd give it a shot. 
        I had to double all the curry spices and added a good helping of garam marsala. I never even tasted a hint of 
        mint so I'm thinking that doubling the mint might help as well. When you're cooking your rice, I would eliminate
         the onions and let the spices sit in the oil until it's nice and fragrant. Then add the rice and cook for five
          minutes to let the rice absorb some of the flavors. Once you've added it to the rest of the recipe don't cook
           on the lowest temp or it will get soggy. You need to cook basmati rice on a med-low heat and much faster to
            avoid soggy rice. This recipe is HUGE. I cut it down to four servings and still had too much food.

        <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>1 (2 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>

    <h3>Steps to make it:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
        <p>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned,
           about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</p></li>
        <li>
        <p>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook 
           and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric;
             cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. 
            Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be 
            necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.</p></li>
        <li>
        <p>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 
            minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary 
            cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</p></li>
        <li>
        <p>Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.</p></li>
        <li>
        <p>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick,
           ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices.</p></li>
        <li>
        <p>Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well. Add chicken mixture and 
            potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting 
            lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring. Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.</p></li>
